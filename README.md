Goals•To modify the class in an existing program.
•To use Strings, integers, and arrays.
•To learn about public, private, static, and final.
•To use private class members with accessors.
•To learn about setting and using the state of an object.
•To write a little bit of Java code, including a function with a loop.2  

InstructionsStart with the Birthday program discussed in class and available on blackboard, and make thesechanges:
•The  original  program  has  three  private  data  members;  add  two  more:  the  number  of  themonth (1..1 and the day of the year (1..365).
•Change the CalculateDay function to initialize the number of the month after it searches forthe month-string.
